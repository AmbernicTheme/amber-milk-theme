Installation method
=============

Easier path to use the original TechDweeb theme pack installer by G.R.H on the Retro Handhelds Discord:
	- Copy the "Theme-MW.sh", "Theme-MW", and "Imgs" script files and two folders together to the 
	  "Roms/APPS" folder in the game partition of Card 1 or Card 2. 
	- After booting up, enter "RA Games - APPS" to see the "Theme-MW" function. 
	- After running, complete the theme installation. 
	- Then you can apply the theme background and icons by selecting which version you prefer.
	
If you have access to the TF1 partition 5 (linuxrootfs), you can copy the theme assets:
	- The contents of the Theme-MW Theme-MW directorty into /mnt/vendor/res
	
If you have access to the TF1 boot partition (partition 2, Volumn), you can copy the boot logo:
	- bootlogo.bmp into the ./ root directory

Porting this theme for the RG35XX+ is a hobby project. Please only use it if you know what you are 
doing, as I take no responsibility and have no means to support you.

Always create backups before you start tinkering.
